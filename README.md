following along doing DaFluffyPotato's PyGame platformer tutorial  

It's a very in-depth tutorial, distilling about 10 years worth of 
gamedev experience in Python. Lots of custom hacks, twists and turns.

I've abandoned this tutorial, switching to algorithms and data structures
for job interviews, since I'm now in job hunting mode. 

I may circle back to play with this down the road; I want to build a 
Defender clone in PyGame, and this tutorial gave me a lot of ideas.  

Coding with Russ is also a great channel that shows how to code a
PyGame platformer.
